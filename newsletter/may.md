Hi there, welcome to our first issue of the newsletter! Here's what's been going on over the past month:

## üìå Highlights

- [üèÖ](https://cur.at/nMARG93?m=web) Voxel Challenge 2022 closed. Check out the final list [here](https://bit.ly/3Q8qUEn)!
- üß© Taichi Lang v1.0.2 released: `pip install taichi==1.0.2`
- üë• Taichi's Slack workspace ready. [Join us](https://taichicommunity.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-14ic8j6no-Fd~wKNpfskXLfqDr58Tddg#/shared-invite/email) to keep up-to-date with the latest progress of the Taichi community. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Releases & Development

- üì£ **Taichi Lang v1.0.2 released!**

  *This patch release improves Taichi's compatibility with multiple platforms.  Particularly, if you run into stability issues with GGUI and Vulkan on v1.0.1, you can upgrade to v1.0.2. For other fixes and improvements, see* *[here](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/releases/tag/v1.0.2)*.

- **‚öíÔ∏è** **Taichi switched to** **[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/taichi-dev/projects/1)** **to encourage more transparent project management.**

  *From 'Backlog' to 'In Progress', all you need to know about the development status of Taichi Lang is at its Kanban* *[here](https://github.com/orgs/taichi-dev/projects/1)*.

##  üóìÔ∏èEvents

- **üî•** **Voxel Challenge 2022 closed on May 25th.** 

  *Voxel Challenge 2022 is for original, ingenious, and Taichi Lang-based voxel artworks. The participants are required to complete their voxel entries within 99 lines of Taichi Lang code.*

  *The competition took place from April 29th to May* *25th. We received from 88 participants 112 entries and 10 blogs. From all these submissions, we see immense creativity and infinite possibilities that Taichi Lang could bring.* 

  *Take a look at the final list* *[here](https://bit.ly/3Q8qUEn)**, and we are sure you will be inspired!*

## üìù Blogs

- **[Is Taichi Lang comparable to or even faster than CUDA?](https://docs.taichi-lang.org/blog/is-taichi-lang-comparable-to-or-even-faster-than-cuda)**

  MAY 6TH, 2022

  *Oftentimes, we were asked how Taichi Lang compares to* *CUDA**? With his benchmark project,* *[Haidong Lan](https://github.com/turbo0628)* *took a stab at comparing Taichi Lang with CUDA's reference implementations of nine algorithms.*

- **[How I created the tranquil autumn air within 99 lines of Python code](https://docs.taichi-lang.org/blog/how-i-created-the-tranquil-autumn-air-within-99-lines-of-python-code)**

  MAY 16TH, 2022

  *[Yuanming Hu](https://github.com/yuanming-hu)**, creator of Taichi Lang, shares how to build a voxel autumn theme from zero to hero.*

## üåü Featured Projects

- **[takah29](https://github.com/takah29)'s** **[2D fluid simulator](https://github.com/takah29/2d-fluid-simulator)**

  *It has long been asked whether Taichi Lang can be used for fluid simulation. Developer* ***[takah29](https://github.com/takah29)*** *has given his answer 'yes' with his* *[2d-fluid-simulator](https://github.com/takah29/2d-fluid-simulator)* *project.* 

  *The project implements a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) solver using* *[Taichi Lang](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi).  With relatively a few lines of code, takah29 implements 2D fluid dynamics simulations* *based on Marker-And-Cell(MAC) method* *in situations of single cylindrical obstacle, multiple cylindrical obstacles, and multiple plate obstacles. takah29 nicely encapsulates the CFD solver* *in object-oriented style (**OOP**)* *and separates* *corresponding functions in* *different modules.* 

  *Taichi Lang was born in the area of Computer Graphics, but has already reached out into many high-performance scientific computing areas, thanks to its innate support for parallel computing on multiple platforms. Unlike many other players in the market, which require deep domain knowledge, Taichi Lang is unbelievably intuitive and, at the same time, highly efficient.* 

  *Want to try it out and be featured in a future newsletter? Taichi is just one command line away! üëâ* `pip install taichi 1.0.2`
