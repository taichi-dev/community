Voxel Challenge
The competition is for original, ingenious, and Taichi Lang-based voxel artworks. The idea is to unleash creativity, so the entries can be on any subject, in any style. The participants are required to complete their voxel entries with Taichi Lang code and submit them before the submission deadline.
