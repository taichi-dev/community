#  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UNLEASH CREATIVITY WITH VOXEL 2022

> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opens: Friday 29th April 2022 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closes: Wednesday 25th May 2022

## Introduction

Taichi Lang is embedded in Python and therefore its renderers can run on any operating system and interact with Python seamlessly. One day, the duo of Yuanming and Ye, the co-founders of Taichi Graphics, put together a GPU-based light tracing voxel renderer on their way back. It then occurred to them that, given that Taichi Lang v1.0.0 was released, they can take the initiative to organize a Taichi Lang-based voxel challenge that is free to enter and open to voxel art lovers from all over the world.

Voxel Challenge 2022 takes place from 29th April 2022 to 25th May 2022. The competition is for original, ingenious, and Taichi Lang-based voxel artworks. The idea is to unleash creativity, so the entries can be on any subject, in any style. The participants are required to complete their voxel entries within 99 lines of Taichi Lang code and submit them before the submission deadline. The Taichi Lang community votes for the winner and runners-up, and the Voxel Challenge Committee (VCC) selects from all entries five Committee's Picks.

## Challenge

The participants of Voxel Challenge 2022 are required to come up with original, inspiring voxel artworks in less than 99 lines of Taichi Lang code. The participants can decide freely on the topics, styles, and material (voxel or light source) to use, so long as their entries are in line with the competition's [Terms and Conditions](#terms-and-conditions). 

> IMPORTANT: Ensure that you run the voxel editor on Taichi Lang v1.0.0. Errors occur if you are on v1.0.1. We plan on fixing the corresponding [issue](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/issues/4891) in the next release. 

### Submission Criteria

- The submission deadline is *2:00 AM PDT 18th May 2022*. Submissions sent after this deadline will not be considered. 
- By submitting their voxel entries the participants agree to the [Terms and Conditions](#terms-and-conditions). 
- See [How to Submit](#how-to-submit) for more information on entry submission. 

### API Usage

Only the following five APIs can be usedï¼š

```python
scene = Scene(voxel_edges=0.06, exposure=3)
# voxel_edges: The width of each voxel's edge. You can set it to 0. 
# exposure: The exposure value, which prevents overexposure or underexposure of the image. 

scene.set_voxel(voxel_index, mat, color)
# voxel_index: A tuple of three integers specifying the postion of the voxel.
#   The Voxel Challenge participants can use floating-point numbers as index for convenience.
#   But note that (3.5, 10.9, 20.2) will be rounded to (4, 11, 20).
#   Valid range of voxel_index: [-64, 63] x [-64, 63] x [-64, 63].
#   Undefined behavior may occur if your input is out of this range. 
#
# mat (material) has the following settings:
#   0: The voxel does not exist (You can use this setting to delete the voxel).
#   1: A voxel that does not emit light.
#   2: A voxel that emits light.
# 
# color: A 3D vector. Its components are real numbers in the range [0.0,1.0] and converted to uint8 (0~255) during accessing. 

mat, color = scene.get_voxel(voxel_index)
# Retrieves the material and color of a specified voxel. 
#
# voxel_index: A tuple of three integers specifying the postion of the voxel.
#   The Voxel Challenge participants can use floating-point numbers as index for convenience.
#   But note that (3.5, 10.9, 20.2) will be rounded to (4, 11, 20).
#   Valid range of voxel_index: [-64, 63] x [-64, 63] x [-64, 63].
#   Undefined behavior may occur if your input is out of this range. 
#
scene.set_floor(height=0, color=(r, g, b))
# Sets the height and color of the floor. The floor has normal vector in the y direction
# 
# color: A 3D vector. Its components are real numbers in the range [0.0,1.0] and converted to uint8 (0~255) during data access. 

Scene.set_directional_light(direction, direction_noise, color)
# Sets the direction of parallel light. 
# See https://github.com/taichi-dev/voxel-challenge/blob/main/example4.py. 
#
# direction_noise: Sets the softness of the shadow (how easily it blends with the background).
# 
# color: A 3D vector. Its components are real numbers in the range [0.0,1.0] and converted to uint8 (0~255) during accessing. 

scene.set_background_color(color)
# Sets the background color. 
# 
# color: A 3D vector. Its components are real numbers in the range [0.0,1.0] and converted to uint8 (0~255) during accessing. 
```

### Size Criteria

- Each participants is given a 128x128x128 voxel grid: 
  - The x, y, or z coordinate of the voxel grid is in the range [-1, 1]; the size of each voxel is 1/64.
  - Note that the index of x, y, or z coordinate starts off from `-64` and ends at `63`. 
- The total number of your code lines must not exceed 99; the number of characters in each line must not exceed 120.

### Screen Capture

- To capture your voxel artwork, you can press **P** after moving your camera and your screenshot appears in the **screenshots** folder.
- The submitted screenshot must be raw and original. Photo editing tools such as Photoshop are not allowed.

### Other Requirements

- The participants cannot create new fields or import libraries other than **scene**, **taichi**, and **taichi.math**. 
- File I/O is not allowed.
